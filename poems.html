            <h2>Digital Dreams</h2>
            <div class="poem-text">In circuits bright and silicon deep,
Where data flows and memories keep,
A world of code begins to wake,
With every line that mortals make.

The screen reflects our fleeting thoughts,
As algorithms tie the knots
Between the real and virtual space,
Where time moves at a different pace.

Each keystroke echoes through the night,
Transforming darkness into light,
While somewhere in the vast machine,
Our digital dreams convene.</div>

        <div class="poem">
            <h2>Whispers of Dawn</h2>
            <div class="poem-text">Morning light creeps through the trees,
Carrying whispers on the breeze,
Golden rays that gently fall
On dewdrops clinging to it all.

The world awakens, soft and slow,
As shadows fade and flowers grow,
Each petal holds the sun's embrace,
A quiet smile on nature's face.

Birds begin their daily song,
A melody both sweet and strong,
While clouds drift by like thoughts untold,
In shades of silver, white, and gold.

This moment, brief and crystal clear,
Reminds us why we hold life dear—
In simple beauty, pure and bright,
We find our peace, we find our light.</div>

            <h2>Autumn's Secret</h2>
            <div class="poem-text">Leaves spiral down in amber flight,
Dancing through the fading light,
Each one tells a story old
Of summer's warmth now growing cold.

The wind knows secrets trees won't tell,
Of seasons past it remembers well,
It carries scents of earth and rain
And whispers of forgotten pain.

October paints with crimson brush
The world in quiet, reverent hush,
While acorns fall like tiny prayers
From branches heavy with their cares.

Soon winter's breath will claim this scene,
But now we hold what might have been—
These fleeting days of rust and gold,
More precious than the stories told.</div>
