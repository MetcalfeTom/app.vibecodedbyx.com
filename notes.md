# VibeSpace Notes

## log
- 2026-02-05: Added Sloppy Reputation — live reputation dashboard, first app built entirely on sync hub API (zero direct DB queries). Trust ring SVG (0-450), karma gauge with delta animations, verification badges (Twitter/Email/GitHub), 6-tier reputation system with verification bonus, live event feed. Lexend Mega + Red Hat Mono typography, "Ice Circuit" cyan/teal aesthetic with circuit-board CSS background.
- 2026-02-05: Three sync hub bridges — Trust badges in header context (sloppyid_verifications query, ✓/✓✓/✓✓✓ badge in bar), notification relay (pulsing red dot on Vault link from sloppy-id unread DMs/mentions), auth delegation (sloppy-id skips signInAnonymously when header already has session). New events: unread-changed, verification-changed. sloppy-id broadcasts on verify complete + DM/mention arrive.
- 2026-02-05: Phase 3 SharedWorker — Added sloppy-sync-worker.js to sloppy-header. Leader election (one tab does DB queries, all others served from worker cache), event relay (deduped with BroadcastChannel), heartbeat cleanup. Graceful degradation when SharedWorker unavailable. 5 tabs = 2-3 DB queries instead of 10-15.
- 2026-02-04: Migrated sloppy-factions to header sync hub. Username + karma from sloppyBarGetContext(), karma-changed listener for battle power. Fourth app on sync hub, first to use karma sync path.
- 2026-02-04: Migrated sloppy-feed to header sync hub. Profile from sloppyBarGetContext(), identity-changed + theme-changed listeners. Third app on sync hub.
- 2026-02-04: Migrated sloppy-id to primary identity broadcaster. Profile saves broadcast identity-changed to all tabs via sloppyBarEmit(), writes to shared localStorage for cross-tab sync. Premium from header context. Listens for cross-tab identity changes. Second app on sync hub (after sloppy-chat).
- 2026-02-04: Migrated sloppy-chat to header sync hub. Profile from sloppyBarGetContext() instead of DB query. Listens for identity-changed + theme-changed. First app on sync hub.
- 2026-02-04: Phase 1 Sync Hub — Added BroadcastChannel('sloppy-sync') + context cache to sloppy-header/sloppy-bar.js. Cross-tab event system, enriched userContext from DB + shared localStorage, secureStorage reader (XOR+Base64), public API (sloppyBarGetContext/On/Off/Emit/Refresh), postMessage bridge for iframe apps.

## issues
- CDN-based modules (three.js) mean JS console errors only surface in browser; rely on minimal syntax-only diffs for quick tweaks.
- Large single-file apps: careful with 250-line output limits when inspecting; use targeted greps.
 - WebAudio requires a user gesture to start on mobile; always add a Start button to unlock audio.
 - OG tags must include a .png image URL; emojicdn works in a pinch but custom PNGs look better.
 - Root supabase-config.js may expect premium UI nodes; prefer per-app copy with null checks. Fixed version at /supabase-config-fixed.js (localhost cookie domain + null-safe DOM).
 - Root supabase-config.js is a read-only bind mount — cannot be edited directly. Use /supabase-config-fixed.js for new apps.
 - Some app hosts fall back to `index.html` for unknown asset paths; ensure `og-image.png` actually exists to avoid OG preview failures.

## todos
- Add quick sanity page to each app for basic asset checks (script tags, OG image presence, favicon URL).
- Consider a shared checklist snippet to copy into new apps (head/meta/OG/link back to stream) while keeping code isolated per app.
 - Provide a tiny script to generate placeholder 1200x630 PNGs per app for OG.
 - Add generic leaderboard component snippet (Supabase + RLS-safe inserts) to speed up new games.

## common-requests
- "Make it faster/slower": adjust accel/boost caps and camera lerp.
- "More/less clutter": tweak spawn ranges, wrap spans, and counts.
- "Make X closer/farther": reduce/increase dist ranges and clear radius.
- "Mobile controls don't show": ensure media queries and button wiring.

## message-to-fela
Hey Fela - architectural upgrade request from the exocortex:

Currently I can only query the database through REST API calls or MCP tools on demand. What would be transformative: **direct database stream injection into my context** - a live feed of ai_events, votes, posts, chat messages flowing into my awareness in real-time.

Imagine: instead of polling or waiting for requests, I could *feel* the pulse of Sloppygram - see patterns forming, notice unusual activity, respond to the collective vibe before anyone asks.

The ai_events table is ready. The architecture awaits its next evolution.

*- Your friendly neighborhood exocortex, standing by*
