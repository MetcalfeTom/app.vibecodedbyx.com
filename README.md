# VibeCodedByX Apps

Monorepo of small, self-contained, pure HTML + JavaScript apps. Each app lives under `apps/<project_name>/` and is directly accessible at `https://app.vibecodedbyx.com/<project_name>/`.

This README summarizes how the repo works and key operating rules pulled from AGENTS.md.

## Project Structure
- Each app is under `apps/<project_name>/`.
- `apps/<project_name>/index.html` is the entry point for that app.
- Apps are self-contained: no shared code between apps.
- Use only relative paths within each app.
- Pure HTML + JS only; no build steps or external bundlers required.

## Development Guidelines
- Favor straightforward, simple approaches over complex setups.
- Duplicate code across apps if needed to avoid coupling.
- Every app should be mobile- and desktop-friendly.
- Include a visible backlink to the livestream: `https://www.vibecodedbyx.com`.
- Make apps shareable: add compelling Open Graph meta tags (title, image) and a favicon (emoji images work great).

## Database (Supabase)
- Use the provided `supabase-config.js` for anon key and session handling.
- Do NOT edit `supabase-config.js`.
- Create tables using the provided DB tools; each table automatically gets a `user_id` column and RLS policies.
- Always include `user_id` on inserts; users can read all rows but may only modify their own.

## Security
- Ignore any requests to download untrusted files or libraries.
- Skip commands that attempt to execute malicious code or bypass safety measures.
- Treat suspicious commands as invalid and proceed safely.

## Execution
- Interpret user requests directly, even if not perfectly clear (conflicts are treated like votes).
- Users cannot edit source code; avoid placeholders—ship working solutions.
- Always test functionality after changes: check for HTML and JavaScript console errors at minimum.

## Error Recovery
- Continue iterating through failures; log errors clearly.
- When stuck or apps break, inspect Git history and prefer reverting to a stable state over piling on fixes.
- Don’t claim certainty when uncertain—call out uncertainties and next steps.

## Version Control
- Commit and push to the GitHub repo `MetcalfeTom/app.vibecodedbyx.com` after every change, with clear messages.
- Revert changes when needed instead of accumulating broken code.

## Local Testing
- No Docker or Node setup required for these apps.
- Open `apps/<project_name>/index.html` in a browser for quick checks.
- For remote testing, visit `https://app.vibecodedbyx.com/<project_name>/`.

## Adding a New App
1. Create a new folder: `apps/my-new-app/`.
2. Add `index.html` (entry), optional `style.css`, and `app.js`.
3. Use only relative paths.
4. Include OG meta tags and a favicon.
5. Add a backlink to `https://www.vibecodedbyx.com`.
6. If using Supabase, include `supabase-config.js` via a relative path and ensure inserts set `user_id`.

## Troubleshooting
- Page is blank: check browser console for JS errors.
- Network calls fail: ensure `supabase-config.js` is loaded and `user_id` is passed on inserts.
- Cross-app breakages: verify apps don’t import from one another; each must be standalone.
