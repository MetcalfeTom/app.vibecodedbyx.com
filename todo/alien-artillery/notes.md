# Alien Artillery - Notes

## Log
- 2025-12-25: Initial creation - sci-fi artillery game with bioluminescent landscape
- 2025-12-25: Added restart functionality, painterly terrain destruction
- 2025-12-25: Added subtle Christmas aurora with red/green bands
- 2025-12-25: Added floating snowflake-like bioluminescent spores
- 2025-12-25: Crater marks now persist like watercolor bleeds - minimalist painting aesthetic

## Features
- Turn-based artillery combat between Green and Purple alien xenos
- Smooth cosine-falloff terrain destruction creates organic craters
- Bioluminescent landscape with glowing flora and spores
- Subtle Christmas touches: aurora with alternating red/green bands, colored snowflake particles
- Wind system affects projectile trajectory
- Touch controls for mobile play

## Aesthetic Direction
- Minimalist bioluminescent sci-fi
- Dark space background with subtle nebula wisps
- Terrain destruction should feel like ink on paper
- Crater marks persist with watercolor-like bleeding effect
- Warm/cool palette hints for Christmas without being obvious

## Issues
- None reported yet

## Todos
- Consider adding sound effects (would require user interaction unlock)
- Possible AI opponent mode
- Power-ups or different weapon types
