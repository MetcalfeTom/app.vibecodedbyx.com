# Neon Donut

## Log
- 2024-12-24: Created spinning 3D neon donut with Three.js
  - Wireframe torus with color cycling
  - Inner layer for depth effect
  - Glow layer for neon aesthetic
  - Mouse interaction for subtle control
  - Pulsing scale animation

## Issues
- None yet

## Todos
- Could add audio reactive features
- Maybe add particle trails

## Notes
- Uses Three.js r128 from CDN
- Color cycles through full hue spectrum
- Simple but hypnotic effect
