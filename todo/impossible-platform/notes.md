# The Impossible Platform

## Log
- Initial creation: Frustrating platformer designed to annoy players
- Trolling mechanics:
  - Fake platforms that look real
  - Disappearing platforms
  - Moving platforms that speed up when you get close
  - Invisible walls
  - Reversed controls on level 3
  - Fake victory flag that kills you
  - Snarky death messages
- 5 levels of increasing frustration
- Death counter to mock player's failures

## Issues
- None yet

## Todos
- Could add sound effects for extra annoyance
- Could add more levels with even more trolling mechanics
- Could add leaderboard of most deaths

## Notes
- Game is intentionally unfair and designed to frustrate
- Every mechanic is designed to trick or surprise the player
- Death messages randomized for variety
- Level 3 has reversed controls without warning
- Level 4 has a fake goal that kills you
- Actually possible to beat if you're patient and learn the tricks
