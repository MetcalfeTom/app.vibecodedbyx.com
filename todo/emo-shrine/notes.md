# Emo Shrine - My Dark Soul

## Log
- Initial creation: Early 2000s emo/scene kid aesthetic website
- Features: Black background, dark red color scheme, silver chains, tribal tattoos
- Animated elements: dangling chains, swaying text, blood drips, flickering effects
- Content: Emo playlist, dark poetry, tribal tattoo symbols, aesthetic grid, manifesto
- Guestbook with classic 2000s usernames and comments
- Baggy jeans emoji as decoration
- Silver chain borders for authenticity

## Issues
- None yet

## Todos
- Could add MySpace-style profile section
- Could add auto-playing music (but probably shouldn't)
- Could add more interactive elements (customizable profile pic, etc.)
- Could add "Top 8 Friends" section

## Notes
- Heavy use of early 2000s emo culture references
- Playlist includes: MCR, Taking Back Sunday, Fall Out Boy, Dashboard Confessional, etc.
- Color scheme: black background, dark red (#8b0000), silver (#c0c0c0)
- Animations: sway, dangle, drip, flicker, pulse-red
- Typography: Creepster for titles, Special Elite for body
- Easter egg: Konami code makes everything flicker intensely
- Mobile responsive
