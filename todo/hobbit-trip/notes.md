- Features: Rainbow animated background, floating elements, twinkling stars, interactive rooms
- Each room has unique personality and poetic descriptions
- Interactive garden with clickable flowers that "plant love"
- Magical messages from fellow travelers
- Continuous color-shifting animation throughout

## Issues
- None yet

## Todos
- Could add sound effects or ambient music
- Could add more interactive elements (clickable objects in rooms)

- Mobile responsive design
