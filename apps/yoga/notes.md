# Yoga App Notes

## Log
- Initial creation: Created yoga pose guide app with 6 common poses
- Features: Interactive pose cards, breathing guide with animation, countdown timer
- Design: Purple gradient background, responsive grid layout, modal popups

## Issues
- None currently identified

## Todos
- Could add more poses
- Could add sequence/flow builder
- Could add user favorites/history with database
- Could add audio guidance for poses
- Could add difficulty levels

## Additional Notes
- App is fully self-contained, no database needed for basic functionality
- Breathing animation uses CSS keyframes for smooth effect
- Timer auto-starts when pose modal opens
