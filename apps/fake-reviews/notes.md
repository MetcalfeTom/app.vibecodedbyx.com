# Fake Reviews App

## Log
- Initial creation: Product review site with hilariously bad AI-written reviews
- Reviews include obvious tells like impossible dates, weird phrasing, robotic speech patterns
- 6 products with 3 reviews each, all trying (and failing) to sound human

## Issues
- None yet

## Todos
- Could add ability for users to submit their own fake reviews
- Could add "suspicious activity detector" that points out the obvious AI tells
- Could add more products

## Notes
- Reviews intentionally include: wrong dates, robot-speak, awkward phrasing, obvious AI patterns
- Each reviewer has suspicious names like "John Human Person" or "TotallyReal_User_479"
- "Verified badges" make it even more obviously fake
