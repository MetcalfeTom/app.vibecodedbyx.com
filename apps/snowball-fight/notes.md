  - Cozy winter theme with falling snow, moon, trees
  - Moving snowman target

## issues

- Could add different targets (moving presents, ornaments)
- Could add power-ups or combo system
- Sound effects would enhance the experience

## notes

- Target moves back and forth across the screen
- Instructions fade after first throw
