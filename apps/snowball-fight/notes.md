# Snowball Fight

## log
- 2025-12-28: Initial creation - festive snowball fight game with chat-based throwing mechanic
  - Cozy winter theme with falling snow, moon, trees
  - Moving snowman target
  - Type messages to throw snowballs with arc physics
  - Hit detection and scoring
  - Floating messages show what you typed
  - Crimson Pro + Fira Code fonts for festive/code aesthetic

## issues
- None so far

## todos
- Could add Supabase leaderboard for high scores
- Could add different targets (moving presents, ornaments)
- Could add power-ups or combo system
- Sound effects would enhance the experience

## notes
- Message length affects accuracy (longer = more accurate, capped at 30 chars effect)
- Target moves back and forth across the screen
- Instructions fade after first throw
- Mobile responsive with smaller snowman on small screens
