# Black Hole Vortex

## log
- 2026-01-08: Initial creation - neon black hole survival game
  - Realistic gravity physics pulling everything toward center
  - Player ship with thrust and boost mechanics
  - Accretion disk with rotating particles
  - Orbital debris and energy orbs to collect
  - Proximity scoring system (closer = more points)
  - Touch controls for mobile

## features
- Gravitational physics simulation
- Black hole with event horizon
- Accretion disk visual effect
- Rotating vortex spirals
- Player ship with trail effect
- Boost ability (uses energy)
- Energy orbs to collect for fuel
- Debris particles in orbit
- Proximity-based scoring
- Touch controls

## controls
- Arrow keys / WASD: thrust in direction
- Space: boost (3x thrust, uses energy)
- Touch: drag to move, tap activates boost

## design
- Deep space black background
- Cyan and magenta neon colors
- Orbitron font for sci-fi aesthetic
- Glowing effects on all elements
- Particle trails and effects

## technical
- Canvas 2D rendering
- Gravitational force: F = G/r² simulation
- Orbital velocity calculations
- Delta-time based physics
- Particle systems for effects

## todos
- Add leaderboard with Supabase
- Add different difficulty levels
- Add gravitational waves effect
- Add multiple black holes mode
- Add power-ups beyond energy
