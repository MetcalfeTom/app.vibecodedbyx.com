# Robo Arm

## log
- 2025-01-02: Initial creation - physics sandbox with robotic arm

## features
- 3-segment robotic arm controlled by mouse/touch
- Inverse kinematics for natural arm movement
- Glowing physics cubes with gravity and collision
- Grab mechanic (hold click/touch)
- Toss cubes based on release momentum
- Cube-to-cube collision physics
- 6 neon cube colors
- Spawn/clear buttons
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space = spawn, C = clear)
- Pulsing glow effects on cubes
- Neon cyberpunk aesthetic

## technical
- Canvas-based rendering
- Simple FABRIK-inspired IK solver
- Physics: gravity, friction, bounce
- Cube collision detection and response
- Touch and mouse input support
- 60fps game loop via requestAnimationFrame

## issues
- None yet

## todos
- Add cube size/mass variation affecting physics
- Add walls/obstacles to bounce cubes off
- Add score for stacking cubes
- Add different arm tools (magnet, pusher)
- Add cube spawner ramp/conveyor
