# Neon Drift

## log
- 2026-01-07: Initial creation - high-speed zero gravity drift racing

## features
- Neon spaceship with glowing trails
- Zero gravity trail particles that float in space
- Hold SPACE/SHIFT to drift with sliding physics
- Drift scoring system with multipliers
- Speed displayed in KM/H
- Floating neon rings as scenery
- Starfield and grid background
- Ship changes color when drifting (cyan to magenta)
- Engine flame animation when accelerating

## controls
- WASD / Arrow keys: Steer and accelerate
- SPACE / SHIFT: Hold to drift
- Mobile: Touch buttons for controls

## design
- Dark space background with subtle grid
- Cyan/magenta neon color scheme
- Orbitron font for futuristic UI
- Particle trails with glow effects
- Floating elliptical rings with rotation
- Camera follows ship smoothly

## technical
- Canvas 2D rendering
- Physics simulation (velocity, friction, angular momentum)
- Drift detection based on angle difference
- Trail particle system with zero gravity
- Score multiplier based on drift duration
- Touch controls for mobile

## todos
- Add track/checkpoints for lap racing
- Add boost pads
- Add AI opponents
- Add leaderboard for drift scores
- Add sound effects (engine, drift squeal)
- Add more visual effects (speed lines, screen shake)
