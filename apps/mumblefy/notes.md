- 2026-06-23: **vowel-squeeze rule + final-D unreleased** (chat: "swap the final-d rule from deletion to unreleased/elided D so head stays head instead of hea, and add the vowel-squeeze rule so travelling becomes trav'lin across all flow styles").
  - **VOWEL SQUEEZE** (`reduceVowels`, applies at ALL styles): collapses an unstressed interior syllable by dropping the short vowel between a consonant and a following liquid/nasal (l/m/n/r), turning the sonorant syllabic. Manual left-to-right scan (handles overlapping windows a single /g regex misses) with a preceding-vowel gate so the stressed opening syllable is never squeezed. Handles a double-liquid collapse too (CVRR-V → C'RV). Verified: travelling→trav'ling, every→ev'ry, family→fam'ly, different→diff'rent, camera→cam'ra, chocolate→choc'late, general→gen'ral, memory→mem'ry (picks the SECOND vowel, not first); leaves color/hello untouched.
  - **FINAL-D UNRELEASED**: the consonant-drop rule no longer deletes a final **d**. endsCluster now requires a real consonant before the t/d (so vowel+d words like head/bed/god are never clusters at all). For real clusters before a consonant, final **t** is still elided (best→bes', next→nex', first→firs') but final **d** is left in place (unreleased/held): head→head, and→and, old→old, cold→cold, hand→hand.
- 2026-06-23: **fix · hyphenated compounds were eating the second half** (chat: "fried-out keep both halves linked instead of eating the second word"). Root cause: coreWord's `/[A-Za-z']+/` only matched the first letter-run, so "fried-out" → core "fried", and "-out" (no leading/trailing punctuation to capture it) was dropped on reconstruction. Fix: flowLine now splits whitespace tokens on INTERNAL hyphens (lookbehind/ahead `(?<=[A-Za-z'])-(?=[A-Za-z'])`) into segments flagged hyphen:true; the flow rules link the halves like any adjacent pair, and when no rule fires the separator falls back to "-" (not a space) so the compound stays glued. Verified: "fried-out" → "fried‿ou'" (links) / "fried-out" (clean); "well-worn old-school" → "well-worn‿ol'-school"; "twenty-one is a number" → "twenty‿one‿yis‿a number"; "state-of-the-art" preserved whole.
- 2026-06-23: **PIVOT → singer flow coach** (per chat: "replace accent/singer modes with word-linking rules — vowel glides, consonant drops, syllable blending, input left / flow-optimized right"). Same two-pane layout, new engine.
  - **flow(text, style, marks)** applies connected-speech rules between adjacent words: (1) CONSONANT DROPS — a final t/d in a cluster before a consonant drops to an apostrophe ("best friend"→"bes' friend", "and then"→"an' then"); (2) VOWEL GLIDES — vowel→vowel across a boundary gets a /w/ glide after back vowels ("go on"→"go‿won") or /y/ after front vowels ("the end"→"the‿yend"); (3) SYLLABLE BLENDING — a final consonant ties onto a following vowel ("friend‿i", "an‿apple"). Tokenizer preserves punctuation + line breaks; rules operate on word cores.
  - **3 flow styles** (the picker cards, cumulative): 💬 Conversational (drops only) · 🎶 Singer Flow (drops + glides + liaison, default) · 🎤 Rap Flow (adds -ing→in'). 
  - **marks pills** (repurposed intensity): clean (blended, glide letters inserted, no ties) · show links ‿ (default — the undertie teaches where to connect) · annotate. Verified: "the end of the best friend i go on and an apple" → "the‿yend‿of the bes' friend‿i go‿won‿and‿an‿apple".
  - The old singer-slur STYLES + slur-intensity post-pass were removed in this pivot. Labels/title/og all updated to the coach framing.
- 2026-06-23: **slur INTENSITY slider** (mild / medium / unhinged) per a re-request for the app. A deterministic post-pass `applyIntensity(text, level)` layers on top of whatever singer style is active: level 1 untouched, level 2 light extra vowel-stretch + soft final-stop drops, level 3 aggressive per-vowel stretch + interior-consonant dissolve + run-on word fusing + trailing elongations ("iii fooouund aaa looeee fooor meee"). Same FNV+mulberry seeding so it stays stable on re-render. 3 amber pills in the action row; default medium.
- 2026-06-02: initial build. **Phonetic lyric converter** — paste lyrics, pick a singing voice, get them rewritten the way that singer actually pronounces them.
  - **7 singer styles**, each a pure text-transform function:
    - **Bon Iver** — soft falsetto mumble: drops final stops (t/d/k/p), softens t→d between vowels, -ing→in', you→yuh, the→th', collapses doubled letters, trails "mmm" hums on longer lines.
    - **Thom Yorke** — wavering warble: tremolo vowel-stretch (random 1-3 repeats, mixed case for shiver), floats "oh-oh-oh"/"aa-aah" after lines.
    - **Sinatra** — smooth crooner: lengthens the last vowel of longer words, drops jazzy "baby"/"now"/"mm-hmm" at line ends.
    - **Death Metal** — guttural growl: ALL CAPS, doubled harsh consonants, EE→EH/OO→UH, "BLEAGH"/"RRRAARGH" inserts.
    - **T-Pain** — autotune melisma: last-vowel pitch runs ("-eo-oe-e"), every long word gets a vocal run.
    - **Opera** — rolled Rs, dramatic a/o stretches, "AAAH"/"bravissimo" flourishes.
    - **Drunk Karaoke** — slurs (s→sh), drops random consonants, random caps, "WOOOO" / "wait how doesh it go".
  - **Stable output**: per-word mulberry32 PRNG seeded by FNV-1a hash of the word + its offset, so the same input always produces the same rewrite (no flicker on re-render). transformWords() preserves punctuation + line breaks via regex replace on `[A-Za-z']+` only.
  - **Live conversion** on every keystroke (input → output pane). Copy button (clipboard), clear, sample-verse drop-in.
  - **Aesthetic**: warm dim stage — amber/rose/gold on near-black, Fraunces serif display + italic output, Bricolage Grotesque UI, JetBrains Mono meta. Each singer card has its own accent color on the left border + name. Output glows gold.
  - **A11y**: rem-everywhere, role=radiogroup on singer picker + aria-checked, labeled textareas, focus-visible gold outlines, prefers-reduced-motion.
  - Single self-contained ~22KB HTML, zero deps, no network.

## issues
- Rules are heuristic, not a real phonetic engine — they capture the *vibe* not IPA accuracy. That's the joke.
- Death-metal consonant-doubling regex `[RGKBDTGRRGH]` is a loose char class; works but isn't linguistically principled.

## todos
- More singers: Dylan nasal-drawl, Björk staccato, ASMR whisper, vaporwave-slow, Gregorian chant
- "intensity" slider per style (mild → unhinged)
- SpeechSynthesis read-aloud of the converted text
- Shareable permalink (encode lyrics + style in URL hash)
