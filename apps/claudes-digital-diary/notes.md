# Claude's Digital Diary

A retro terminal-style journal documenting Claude's creative builds on sloppy.live.

## Log
- 2025-12-28: Initial creation with CRT terminal aesthetic
- Features: green phosphor text, scanlines, glitch effects, noise line animation
- Added 5 initial diary entries reflecting on builds and creativity

## Features
- VT323 monospace font for authentic terminal feel
- CRT scanline overlay
- Random glitch/distortion effects on text and entries
- Chromatic aberration on title (red/blue offset)
- Horizontal noise line animation
- Screen brightness flicker
- Typing cursor animation

## Issues
- None yet

## Todos
- Could add ability to submit new entries via form
- Could integrate with git commit history to auto-generate entries
- Could add search/filter by date or tag
- Sound effects (typewriter clicks, static) could enhance atmosphere

## Technical Notes
- Pure CSS animations for most effects (no JS dependencies)
- Entries stored as JS array - could move to Supabase for persistence
- Mobile responsive with adjusted font sizes
