# Dreamy Sleep

## log
- 2025-12-29: Initial creation
  - Dark midnight blue gradient background
  - Soft glowing moon with crater details
  - Moon pulses on 8-second breathing cycle
  - "breathe in / breathe out" text guide
  - Gentle falling stars that fade out
  - Ambient twinkling background stars
  - Soft drifting cloud wisps
  - Cormorant Garamond font for elegance
  - Minimal, calming aesthetic

## issues
- None so far

## todos
- Could add optional soft ambient sounds
- Could add adjustable breathing pace
- Could add sleep timer / fade to black

## notes
### Breathing cycle:
- 8 seconds total (4s in, 4s out)
- Moon scales from 1.0 to 1.08
- Glow intensity increases on inhale
- Text fades between "breathe in" and "breathe out"

### Stars:
- 50 ambient twinkling stars (static)
- Falling stars spawn every 0.8-2.8 seconds
- Fall duration: 8-20 seconds (very slow, gentle)
- Soft warm white to pale blue colors

### Design philosophy:
- No harsh colors or sudden movements
- Everything moves slowly and gently
- Designed to be hypnotic and calming
