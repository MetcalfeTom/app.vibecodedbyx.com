                correct: 1,
                difficulty: "easy",
                explanation: "The 'request' package was deprecated in 2020 after being one of the most popular packages for making HTTP requests. It was eventually replaced by native fetch and modern alternatives like axios."

                correct: 3,
                difficulty: "medium",
                explanation: "Before ES6 promises, developers used libraries like Q, Bluebird, and When.js. These are now largely deprecated as native promises are standard in all modern JavaScript environments."

                difficulty: "easy",
                explanation: "Grunt was the dominant build tool in the early 2010s, using configuration over code. It was eventually overtaken by Gulp (code over configuration) and then webpack (module bundling)."

                difficulty: "hard",
                explanation: "Optimist was deprecated in favor of yargs. The author even added a deprecation notice saying 'If you know what you're doing, it's probably still fine, but there are better options out there.'"

                correct: 0,
