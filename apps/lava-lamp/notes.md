# Neon Lava Lamp

## log
- 2026-01-11: Created high-fidelity neon lava lamp with gooey metaball physics

## features
- Metaball rendering for smooth gooey blob visuals
- Heat-based buoyancy physics (blobs rise when hot, sink when cool)
- 6 color schemes with smooth transitions
- 8 initial blobs (up to 15 max)
- Blob pulsing and wobble animation
- Blob-to-blob repulsion for organic movement
- Realistic lamp container with cap, glass, and base
- Glass reflection highlights
- Dynamic glow effect matching current color
- Controls: change colors, add blobs, toggle heat intensity
- Auto color change every ~100 seconds (10% chance)
- Mobile and desktop friendly

## issues
