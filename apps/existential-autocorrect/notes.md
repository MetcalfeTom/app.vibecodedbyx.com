# Existential Autocorrect

An autocorrect that fixes typos but has an existential crisis about whether "keyboard" is spelled correctly.

## Log
- 2025-12-28: Initial creation with keyboard-triggered existential crisis

## Features
- Real autocorrect for common typos (teh, adn, recieve, etc.)
- Existential crisis triggered by any keyboard-related word
- Crisis meter that fills up the more you mention keyboards
- Internal monologue showing panicked thoughts
- Keyboard spelling variations display (all look equally valid/invalid)
- Shaking animations during peak crisis
- Calm thoughts when no keyboard is mentioned
- Slowly recovers from crisis when keyboard removed

## Panic Triggers
- keyboard, keybaord, keybord, keyborad, keybroad
- keybard, keyboatd, keyboadr, keyboaard, keybored
- Any word starting with "keyb", "kyb", or "keb"

## Technical Notes
- Pure vanilla JS, no dependencies
- Debounced input processing (300ms)
- Cycling thoughts during crisis mode
- Preserves punctuation and capitalization in corrections

## Todos
- Could add more crisis triggers (maybe "necessary" or "rhythm")
- Sound effects (anxious typing sounds?)
- Share button for particularly panicked outputs
