# Cosmic Chat - The Wormhole Garden

## Log
- Initial creation: Surreal cosmic chat community with dark twist
- Theme: Wormhole (🌀) + Apple (🍎) + Star (⭐) lovechild
- Features: Real-time chat using Supabase, message corruption system, animated wormhole background
- Dark twist: Random messages get "corrupted" with glitch characters (20% chance)
- Stats tracker: Total transmissions, corrupted messages, fluctuating "void strength"
- Cosmic aesthetic: Purple/magenta/green color scheme, space theme, spinning wormholes
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

## Issues
- None yet

## Todos
- Could add ability to "uncorrupt" messages with special actions
- Could add different corruption levels based on void strength
- Could add cosmic events that affect all users
- Could add private wormhole channels
- Could add user avatars/cosmic identities

## Notes
- Uses Supabase for real-time chat functionality
- Messages have 15-20% chance of being corrupted on send/display
- Corruption replaces characters with glitch symbols: █▓▒░◆◇◈✦✧⚠☠⚡
- Animated elements: spinning wormhole, pulsing stars, drifting messages, glitching corrupted messages
- Color scheme: Black bg, purple (#8a2be2), magenta (#ff00ff), green (#0f0), red (#8b0000)
- Space Mono font for that retro-futuristic terminal feel
- Mobile responsive design
