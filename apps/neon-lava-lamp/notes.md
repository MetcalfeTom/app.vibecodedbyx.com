# Neon Lava Lamp

## log
- 2025-01-01: Initial creation - physics-based lava lamp with glowing blobs

## features
- Realistic blob physics (buoyancy, gravity, drag)
- Temperature simulation (heat rises, cool sinks)
- Soft collision detection between blobs
- Organic wobbling shapes
- 4 color palettes: Neon, Sunset, Ocean, Toxic
- Glow effects and highlights
- Click/tap to add heat and push blobs
- Responsive design

## technical
- Canvas-based rendering
- Custom physics engine with temperature model
- Quadratic bezier curves for organic blob shapes
- Radial gradients for glow effects
- RequestAnimationFrame loop

## issues
- None yet

## todos
- Add sound toggle (ambient bubble sounds)
- Add lamp brightness control
- Add blob count slider
- Add shake/tilt interaction on mobile
