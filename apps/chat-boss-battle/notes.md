- Currently just auto-simulates attacks (no real chat integration)
- No persistent leaderboard across sessions
- No authentication or user tracking
- Heal command might be annoying (intentional troll feature)

- Add special attacks with cooldowns
- Add boss abilities that fight back
- Add sound effects
- Add combo system for consecutive attacks
- Add difficulty modes
- Consider adding team vs team battles
- Add boss enrage timer
