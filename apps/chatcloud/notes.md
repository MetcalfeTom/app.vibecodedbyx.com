# Chat Cloud App

## Log
- Created interactive word cloud with physics simulation
- Words from today's chat (rocketship, gitscope, git terms, astrology, mood, mouse, etc.)
- Full physics: collision detection, gravity toggle, wall bouncing
- Interactive: drag words, shake, explode, gravity toggle
- Touch support for mobile

## Issues
- Performance could degrade with many more words
- Collision detection is approximate

## Todos
- Could pull words from actual chat history via API
- Could adjust word sizes based on frequency
- Could add word linking/clustering
- Could add sound effects for collisions
