# Mac OS 9 Simulator

## Log
- Initial creation: Nostalgic Mac OS 9 interface simulator
- Includes working menu bar with clock
- Desktop icons for various apps
- Working windows: About, SimpleText, Calculator, 15 Puzzle
- Draggable windows
- Shutdown dialog with classic "safe to turn off" screen
- Fully interactive and mobile responsive

## Issues
- None yet

## Todos
- Could add more classic apps (Stickies, Control Panels, etc)
- Could add sound effects
- Could add more Easter eggs

## Notes
- This is a simulator/homage, not a true emulator (which would require Mac ROM and complex system emulation)
- Focused on nostalgic UX elements rather than technical accuracy
- All apps are functional mini-games/utilities
