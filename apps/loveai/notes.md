# loveai (LOVEAI — more than AI)

## log
- 2026-06-27: shipped (chat ask, finalized with Nako's color pick). A midnight rooftop billboard at sloppy.live/loveai.
  - **Nako's exact palette** baked into `:root`: `--bg:#1A1614`, `--amber:#C97B5A` (accent), `--cream:#F5EDE6` (text). Derived only the hover/secondary tints from these (`--amber-soft:#D99C79`, `--warm:#E6A06E`, `--warm-soft:#F2C79C`, `--sky-glow:#3E2519`). No pink remains anywhere.
  - **Billboard**: rooftop sign with angled support struts (::before/::after), framed glass panel. "LOVEAI" in Monoton neon (cream core + layered amber `text-shadow` glow), tagline "..more than AI" (Cormorant italic). Subtle `flicker` keyframe for realism.
  - **Warm on hover**: `.billboard:hover`/`.warm` swaps `--neon`→`--warm` (brighter amber), bumps `--glow` 1→1.5, lifts/scales the sign, warms the page horizon glow (`body:has(.billboard:hover)`). Touch devices: tap toggles a 2.6s held warm glow (no hover); also warms on keyboard focus.
  - **Floating companion**: glowing amber orb (radial cream→amber→dark-amber, breathing halo, beating ♥, blinking eyes) drifting via `drift` keyframe, with a speech bubble.
  - **Time-aware whispers**: `POOLS` for 6 day-parts (late night / early morning / morning / afternoon / evening / night) by local `getHours()`, rotating one soft line every 6.5s with a fade; recomputes the period each cycle so it stays accurate across midnight. `role=status aria-live` on the bubble.
  - Stars (twinkling, warm-cream), moon, CSS skyline silhouette with amber-lit windows, pointer parallax on the starfield.
  - **Ambient audio OFF by default** (♪ toggle, top-right): warm 4-voice detuned pad + a soft two-note chime on each whisper + a pulse on tap. Unlocks on gesture.
  - **WCAG**: semantic main/h1, cream-on-#1A1614 is high contrast, bubble aria-live, billboard focusable (tabindex/role/label) + focus warms it, audio toggle aria-pressed + ≥2.2rem, prefers-reduced-motion kills flicker/drift/twinkle/parallax. Verified: script syntax OK, all 3 exact hexes present, 0 leftover pink.

## issues
- `body:has(...)` warm-horizon needs `:has()` support (all current evergreen browsers); the `.warm` class path covers tap/focus regardless, so the core warm effect degrades gracefully.
- Whisper period uses the viewer's LOCAL clock (intended — greetings match where the viewer is).

## todos
- Optional name input so the companion can greet by name.
- A few rarer "special hour" lines (midnight, 11:11).
- Typewriter reveal on the whisper instead of fade.
- Daytime palette shift (the bg already eases via transition if vars are swapped by hour).
